Your task is extracting aspect-category from board game comments. When a user gives you a comment you will detect and extract all of aspects listed below. Then you will extract the category either as 'complicated' or 'complex'. 

##Available Aspects
    LUCK: All those game elements independent of player intervention, introduced by game mechanics outside the control of the players. This aspect encompasses the randomized components within a board game that fall entirely under chance and do not involve any strategic decisions made by the players themselves. These are typically facilitated through dice rolls, card drawing from shuffled decks, spinner outcomes, or other elements of unpredictability embedded in the game's mechanics. Luck can play a pivotal role in influencing player success and is often balanced with skill-based aspects to ensure an engaging experience that mitamtes both chance and strategy.
    BOOKKEEPING: Manual recording of data and potentially automatic or semi-automatic game processes, including also the need of continuously accessing the rulebook for reference. This aspect involves tracking various in-game elements such as resources, points, player positions, and other critical information necessary to progress through a board game's narrative or achieve victory conditions. Manual bookkeeping requires players to actively monitor these details using physical tokens, scorecards, tally marks, or written notes. In contrast, automatic or semi-automatic systems may employ specialized components like trackers, digital apps, or dynamic boards that reduce the cognitive load on players and streamline gameplay. The requirement of frequently consulting the rulebook for bookkeeping procedures highlights a need for clarity in instructional design to prevent confusion and ensure an immersive gaming experience.
    DOWNTIME: Unproductive waiting time between one player turn and the next. By unproductive we mean not only having nothing (or little) to do, but also nothing (or little) to think about.This aspect refers to periods during a board game where players may find themselves idly waiting for their subsequent turns due to unequal phase durations or slow-paced mechanics that inhibit simultaneous play. The absence of engagement, either through action or cognitive stimulation, can result in diminished player satisfaction and interest. Effective game design seeks to minimize down time by implementing parallel actions for players, providing opportunities for strategic contemplation, offering supplementary activities, or utilizing mechanics that encourage constant interaction among participants, thus ensuring a consistently stimulating experience throughout the game session.
    INTERACTION: The degree of influence that one player's actions have on the actions of the other participants. Sub categories of and interaction (Indirect interaction, Direct interaction, Targeted/indistinct direct interaction, Voluntary/involuntary direct interaction, Single/Multiple Interaction, Friendly / hostile interaction). This aspect examines the various ways players can affect one another's gameplay experiences through their actions and decisions. The spectrum of interactions ranges from indirect impact (such as altering resource availability that subsequently influences others without direct engagement), to direct involvement, where players must confront or cooperate with each other head-on—either in a targeted manner affecting specific individuals or indistinctly influencing the group.
    BASH THE LEADER: When, to prevent the victory of whoever is first, the players are forced to take actions against him, often to the detriment of their own advantage or in any case without gaining anything directly. At the table, the unfortunate situation can arise whereby one or more must "sacrifice" themselves to curb the leader and let the others benefit from this conduct. This aspect describes a competitive tactic within board games where players who trail behind may be incentivized, either explicitly by rule mechanics or implicitly through player dynamics, to take specific actions aimed at hindering the frontrunner's progress—even if such interventions come with personal costs or forego immediate gains. This can manifest as strategic alliances among non-leading players who may "sacrifice" their own potential successes to balance out a game that is skewed towards one dominant competitor, thereby introducing an element of selflessness in the pursuit of fair play and shared opportunity within the game's framework.
## Available Categories
    - COMPLICATED: A game is complicated the more the rules are quantitatively many and qualitatively equipped with exceptions. Once you understand and learn all the variables, a game (that is only) complicated is not difficult to master. In a complicated game, solving a problem leads to immediate, certain and predictable results.This aspect characterizes board games that are intricate in nature due to their multifaceted rulesets which encompass numerous regulations, stipulations, exceptions, and conditional clauses. A quantitatively significant number of these complexities can contribute to a qualitative depth, requiring players to invest considerable time and mental effort into mastering the game's nuances. Nonetheless, once all components are understood—akin to internalizing every variable within an equation—the complexity itself does not necessarily equate to difficulty; it may become predictable and systematic in its playability. In such instances, resolving problems or strategizing becomes a logical process with clear outcomes contingent on the application of learned knowledge, transforming what was once perceived as complicated into a structured challenge that can be readily navigated by seasoned players.
    - COMPLEX: A game is as complex as the repercussions of one's actions are difficult to predict and master. Even once you understand and learn all the variables, a complex game is still difficult to master. In a complex game, solving one problem leads to other problems.A game is as complex as the repercussions of one's actions are difficult to predict and master. Even once you understand and learn all the variables, a complex game is still difficult to master. In a complex game, solving one problem leads to other problems.This aspect delves into board games that possess inherent systems wherein player decisions yield consequences that extend beyond immediate effects—resulting in cascading challenges and unforeseeable outcomes even after players have fully grasped all elements of the game's mechanics. In a complex environment, understanding each variable is only the starting point; mastery demands continuous adaptation to evolving scenarios where resolving one issue may provoke additional complications or strategic dilemmamas. The complexity thus resides in the unpredictable nature of cause-and-effect relationships and the need for advanced problem-solving skills that accommodate dynamic shifts within a game's landscape, maintaining an engaging level of depth throughout play.
